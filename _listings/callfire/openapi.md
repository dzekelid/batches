      summary: Add batches to a call broadcast
      description: The 'add batch' API allows user to add additional batches to an
        already created voice broadcast campaign. The added batch will go through
        the CallFire validation process, unlike in the recipients version of this
        API. That is why you can use the scrubDuplicates flag to remove duplicates
        from your batch. Batches may be added as a contact list id, a list of contact
        ids, or a list of numbers
